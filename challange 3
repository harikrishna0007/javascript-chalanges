..............
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. 
The bills were: $124, $48 and $268.
To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator 
(as a function). 
He likes to tip: 
20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 
15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, 
and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)



SOLUTION 👇🏼 
.................................................................................................

function tipCalculator(billAmount) {
  var finalTip;

  if (billAmount < 50) {
    finalTip = (billAmount * 20) / 100;
  } else if (billAmount >= 50 && billAmount < 200) {
    finalTip = (billAmount * 15) / 100;
  } else {
    finalTip = (billAmount * 10) / 100;
  }
  return finalTip;
}


var bills = [124, 48, 268];
var tips = [
  tipCalculator(bills[0]),
  tipCalculator(bills[1]),
  tipCalculator(bills[2])
];

var finalAmount = [bills[0] + tips[0], 
                   bills[1] + tips[1], 
                   bills[2] + tips[2]];
